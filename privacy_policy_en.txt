sahur is designed with privacy in mind. We do NOT collect, store, or share personal data.

The App may access the following information solely to provide core functionality:

• Location data (optional)
Used to calculate accurate prayer times and countdowns.
Location data is processed locally on your device and is NOT sent to our servers.

Used only to send reminders for Sahur, Iftar, or prayer times.
We do not track notification interactions.

We do NOT collect:
• Names
• Email addresses
• Phone numbers
• Device identifiers
• Usage analytics
• Advertising identifiers

--------------------------------------------------
2. How We Use Information
--------------------------------------------------

Any information accessed by the App is used only to:

• Display accurate prayer times
• Calculate Sahur and Iftar countdowns
• Determine Qibla direction (if enabled)
• Send reminders based on your preferences

All processing happens locally on your device.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Data Storage
--------------------------------------------------

sahur does NOT store personal data on external servers.

Any app settings (such as selected location or language preference) are stored locally on your device and can be removed by clearing the app data or uninstalling the App.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Data Sharing
--------------------------------------------------

We do NOT share your data with:
• Third-party advertisers

No personal or identifiable information is shared with these sources.

--------------------------------------------------
6. Children’s Privacy
--------------------------------------------------

sahur does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

Since no personal data is collected, the App is safe for general audiences.
